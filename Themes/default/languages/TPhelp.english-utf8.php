<h2 class="tphelp">&nbsp; Introduction To TinyPortal</h2>
<p class="tphelp">
<a href="http://www.tinyportal.net" target="_blank">TinyPortal</a> (TP) is a magnificent modification of <a href=http://simplemachines.org" target="_blank">Simple Machines Forum</a> (SMF). It will turn your simple SMF forum into a fully operational portal. It will expand your SMF forum with Frontpage options, Articles, Panels filled with Blocks, and Plugins, with an on-going list of Module add-ons to choose from.</p>

<p class="tphelp">Developed to work seamlessly with SMF, it uses many of its internal functions and is therefore more secure. There is no need for 2 admin interfaces, memberbases, or themes to manage as with other portals. Tiny Portal will operate on a single software system. The best way to put it: "TinyPortal" is an extension of the "Simple Machines Forum", not 2 different integrated softwares.</p>

<p class="tphelp">TinyPortal enables you to setup HTML/Javascript, PHP, or BBC articles and blocks. Expanded permissions give you all the admin/user options you could ask for. Adding content to your site has never been easier, and it will have your site carrying that professional appeal.</p>

<p class="tphelp">Best of all, it\'s FREE!</p><br />

<div class="information" style="margin-top: 1em; padding: 2ex;"><b class="tphelp">TinyPortal Features Include</b>:</div><br />

<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Articles</b>: are HTML, PHP, BBC, imported or external pages with optional author information and visual options to show alone, with panels & blocks, and/or with other articles. All articles can be categorized, or have comments and ratings.</p>
<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Frontpage</b>: is the first page or index page of your TP & SMF site. TP gives you ability to dress up your frontpage any way you see fit using forum posts, articles, panels & blocks, and even modules. If you\'re not interested in all that, you can choose for your frontpage to go directly to your forum index. </p>
<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Panels</b>: are several sections or containers that hold all of your blocks. There is the top panel, upper panel, frontpanel, lower panel, bottom panel, left panel, and right panel. These panels help control the layout of your TP & SMF driven forum.</p>
<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Blocks</b>: these are small boxes of information or functions in HTML, PHP, or BBC. They can be placed in any order, in any panel and section/action of the TP & SMF driven site.</p>
<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Modules</b>: are enhancements to TinyPortal written by various developers that add new abilities to the overall functions of the site. Examples of a module would be: File Manager, Gallery Manager, and Chat.</p>
<p class="tphelp">- <b class="tphelp">Plugins</b>: are modifications to existing TinyPortal features or modules that extend its abilities. For example, if someone made a modification to add a WYSIWYG editor that can be used in articles or blocks.</p>

$txt['tphelp_articles_main']= '
<h2 class="tphelp">&nbsp; Articles</h2>

<b class="tphelp">Admin</b>:
<p class="tphelp">You can enter your "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Articles > Articles & Categories</span>" section and create unlimited categories & subcategories for all of your articles. For each category you create, you can choose your sorting options, which membergroups have access to that category, the article layout, and how many articles to display per page just to name a few.</p><p class="tphelp"> After that, take a look at your "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Articles > Settings</span>" page and decide if you want to show a category icon, or even hide the quick edit link under each article.</p><p class="tphelp">If you keep browsing, you will also find a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Articles > Submission</span>" page. Here you will find options to select which membergroups can submit an article. Once your users begin writing articles, their submission will appear on this page for approval before it can actually be viewed by other users.</p> 

<p class="tphelp">The types of articles are HTML, PHP, BBC, Imported, or External pages that can be added to your site. Every article carries with it the options to display views, blocks, date, author, avatar, and or linktree. It even have additional options such as what theme it should be viewed in, no theme at all, ratings, and/or user comments.</p>

<p class="tphelp">Unlike forum topics, articles can be whole pages of information, stories, or even scripts to suit your needs. You can decide which panels & blocks you want to show with it, and even show links to other article categories or articles. With this kind of flexibility, you can set up a professional looking site in no time...</p>

<b class="tphelp">User</b>:
<p class="tphelp">All users can submit articles if the admin has given permission for the user to do so. Permissions are given on a membergroup basis.</p>
Assuming you have permissions to write articles you\'ll often find the links to do so within the userbox block. If the site you are using does not have a userbox, you can always find a list of all your written articles within your "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Profile > TinyPortal > Articles</span>". From here you can submit new articles or even edit your already existing articles. 

<p class="tphelp">When submitting an article, you must fill in the title & body to suit your needs. Afterwards, the article submitted needs approval by the admin or the admin\'s article moderation team before it can be viewed by the public, unless otherwise set by the admin. All visual options such as panel use, the theme it is displayed in, and other statistics are controlled by the admin or his/her team. All currently non-active articles will give an error when viewed, and are also marked in italic style. Articles not yet approved yet are likewise marked with surrounding parentheses around the title within the subject area...</p>

<p class="tphelp">Through the use of plugins, other article options may be added. You will find any of the changes/settings located in your "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Profile > TinyPortal > Articles > Settings</span>".</p>

<div class="information" style="margin-top: 1em; padding: 2ex;">This is a summary. For FAQ, please browse our <a href="http://www.tinyportal.net/docs/index.php?board=9.0" target="_blank"><b class="tphelp">Article Documentation</b></a>.</div>
